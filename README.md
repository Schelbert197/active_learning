# Active Learning

This repository includes my plots and code exploring the fundamentals of active learning. The directories include Bayes' update, infotaxis, Gaussian Mixture Models, Optimal Control, and Ergodic Control. 

These directories include plots created from Jupyter Notebooks. For those who would like to try, they can be downloaded and run locally. This does require that the various packages are installed correctly. Please note that infotaxis will create and delete directories to create a video which may not be immediatly compatible if run on a remote machine (e.g. Google CoLab)
